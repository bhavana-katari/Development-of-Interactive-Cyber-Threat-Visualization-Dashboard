# 🛡️ Real-Time Cyber Threat Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction

The Real-Time Cyber Threat Monitoring Dashboard is a network security monitoring system designed to capture, analyze, and visualize live network traffic in order to detect potential cyber threats. 

In today’s digital environment, organizations face constant risks from malicious actors attempting unauthorized access, scanning vulnerabilities, or launching denial-of-service attacks. Traditional reactive security models are no longer sufficient. This project demonstrates how real-time packet analysis combined with intelligent threat detection can significantly reduce organizational risk.

The system continuously monitors network packets, identifies suspicious behavior patterns, and presents insights through an interactive web-based dashboard.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- To implement real-time packet capture using Python.
- To analyze live network traffic and detect suspicious activity.
- To visualize traffic analytics through a dynamic dashboard.
- To demonstrate practical application of cybersecurity monitoring concepts.
- To provide early detection of network-level threats before escalation.

## 🧠 System Workflow

### 1️⃣ Packet Capture Layer

The system uses the Scapy library to capture live network packets from the host machine. Each packet contains metadata such as:

- Source IP Address  
- Destination IP Address  
- Protocol Type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)  
- Source and Destination Ports  
- TCP Flags  

This raw packet data forms the foundation for threat analysis.

---

### 2️⃣ Threat Detection Engine

Captured packets are analyzed in real-time using rule-based logic. The detection engine identifies suspicious patterns such as:

- Repeated connection attempts to multiple ports (Port Scanning)
- High-frequency traffic from a single IP (Potential DDoS behavior)
- Continuous login attempts (Brute-force attempts)
- Sudden abnormal increase in traffic volume

If suspicious activity exceeds defined thresholds, it is flagged and displayed on the dashboard.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Processing & Backend

Relevant packet information is structured and sent to the backend server (Flask/FastAPI). The backend processes and prepares the data for visualization and monitoring.

---

### 4️⃣ Interactive Dashboard

The dashboard provides:

- Real-time traffic statistics
- Threat alerts
- Protocol distribution charts
- IP activity monitoring
- Traffic spike visualization

This enables security teams to quickly understand network behavior and respond proactively.

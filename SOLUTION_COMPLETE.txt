CYBER THREAT DASHBOARD - FINAL STATUS
THREAT HISTORY TABLE + ANALYTICS COMPLETE
================================================================================

✓✓✓ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED ✓✓✓

Date: February 9, 2026
Status: PRODUCTION READY

================================================================================
TABLE RENDERING - FIXED AND WORKING
================================================================================

WHAT WAS WRONG:
• dbc.Table (Bootstrap Table) was hiding cell content due to CSS conflicts
• Cells existed but content wasn't visible (invisible text or hidden cells)

WHAT WAS FIXED:
• Changed from dbc.Table to html.Table (pure HTML, no Bootstrap interference)
• Added explicit column widths for each cell (5%, 15%, 15%, 12%, 18%, 12%, 13%)
• Applied explicit padding, text alignment, and min-height
• Set borderCollapse="collapse" for proper table rendering
• All inline styles applied directly without Bootstrap overrides

RESULT: ✓ ALL DATA NOW VISIBLE IN EVERY ROW AND COLUMN

================================================================================

You get a comprehensive Threat Intelligence Report with:

1. SEVERITY DISTRIBUTION (Bar Chart)
   Shows: High (4), Medium (3), Low (2), Critical (1)
   Color-coded bars for each severity level
   NOT "100% of one thing" - actual distribution of all severities

2. THREAT TYPE DISTRIBUTION (Pie Chart)
   Shows: DDoS (40%), SQL Injection (30%), Ransomware (20%), Malware (10%)
   Top 8 threat types displayed
   Reflects actual threat occurrences in data

3. TOP ATTACK SOURCES (Horizontal Bar Chart)
   Shows: USA (4 attacks), Russia (3), UK (1), Germany (1), India (1)
   Countries ranked by number of attacks
   Based on actual source IP data

4. THREAT STATUS (Donut Chart)
   Shows: Observed (5), Blocked (3), Investigated (2)
   All status values represented
   Reflects actual distribution

5. THREAT TIMELINE (Line Chart with Area Fill)

   Time series of threats
   Orange line with filled area

SUMMARY STATISTICS:
  • Total Threats: 10
  • Unique Sources: 9 (unique IPs)

  • Top Country: USA (4 attacks)

KEY POINT: Charts are DATA-DRIVEN, not fixed 100% values showing the same thing.
Each chart reflects the actual distribution in your threat data.
